The t_test and summary python programs sumamrize the data and perform a t test for the data. 

The datasetPage.xlsx is the data that python code transforms into summary.xlsx and t_test_results.xlsx and also prints them in the console.

If you want to change the data you can use own file names, just replace the 'datasetPage.xlsx' with your own filename. 

Note! this code accesses the first page of the xlsx file.
